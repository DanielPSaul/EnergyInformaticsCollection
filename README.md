### Energy Informatics Collection

**Concepts:** Statistics, Sustainability, Renewable Energy Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Data Transformation and Wrangling, Linear Regression, Optimization and Prescriptive Analytics

**Software & Languages:** RStudio, Markdown, R

**Packages:** tidyverse, lubridate, tinytex, gt, dygraphs, xts, eia, EIAdata, lpSolveAPI, TSP, ggmap, mapproj, measurements, googleway

**Description:** This repository holds a collection of multiple pair assignments that were not large enough for their own repository I completed for a Energy Informatics course at UGA. The code utilizes R and Markdown to clean and present data that represents various sustainable methods in energy informatics. We dealt with weather and radiation data to calculate energy generated over time, temperature and renewable energy analysis over time, and crop production and supply chain efficiency. I have also included a small group presentation to display the content we were working with in visual sense.
